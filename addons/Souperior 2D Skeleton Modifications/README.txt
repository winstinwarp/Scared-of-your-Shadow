Thanks for downloading my plugin :]

If you like the plugin, you can throw a couple dollars my way over at 
https://boosty.to/zedmanul/donate
It'd be greatly appreciated :)

Current soupy modifications:
	LookAt
	StayAt
	TwoBoneIK
	JiggleBones
	Angle and Position Constraints
	FABRIK

Planned soupy modifications:
	NONE, we done for now ;)

I did my best to write up comments and clean up the code.
You should be able to gather most of the needed info 
about the usage of various nodes by opening the script of the node you are interested in,
pressing f1, typing "Soup" and opening the autogenerated documentation for the node.

Additionally, I have provided a demo scene that can help you get a grasp on the intended usage of the addon.

NOTE: ORDER OF MODIFICATIONS *MATTERS*.
Modifications nodes are executed from top to bottom in the tree
i.e.:
>Stack
>>TwoBoneIK
>>LookAt
TwoBoneIK will be executed FIRST.
If you are experiencing weird jittering on one of the modified nodes, its likely cuz you messed up the order.
Here's how it *should* go:
>Overall order:
>>Modifications on "parent" bones
>>Modifications on "child" bones 
(i.e. modifications on body/spine, then modifications on arm, then modifications on hand)
>Order when modifying the same bone:
>>StayAt's first
>>everything else after


Skeletons are, alas, still a bit buggy, and weird edgecases arise when shifting nodes around.
If something seems to be broken, try reloading your project.
Skeletons are weird like that.

There is now support for custom easing motion on all modifications!
I am quite happy with how the system turned out, 
and I will likely make it a separate plugin later on.

Soupy Nodes are entirely separate from the inbuilt skeleton modifications, 
and applying both at the same time to one bone may be a bad idea.

The system also relies on bone angle and length, so make sure to
disable "auto calculate" on bones that dont have any further child bones.
